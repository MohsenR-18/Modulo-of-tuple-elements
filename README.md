# Modulo-of-tuple-elements
Sometimes, while working with records, we can have a problem in which we may need to perform a modulo of tuples. This problem can occur in day-day programming. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this task can be performed. 

# Example
<b>Input</b>:
<br> tuple 1 : (10, 4, 5, 6)
<br> tuple 2 : (5, 6, 7, 5)
<br> 
<b>Output</b>:
<br> The modulus tuple : (0, 4, 5, 1)
